Website : https://sjshreya-resume.netlify.app/

This repository hosts my personal resume website, a dynamic and interactive platform designed to showcase my professional journey. Unlike a static document, this website offers a comprehensive overview of my skills, experience, and projects in an engaging and accessible format. It's built with modern web technologies to ensure a seamless and responsive experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Key Features
The website boasts several features to enhance user experience and present my profile effectively:

Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, guaranteeing a consistent and readable layout no matter how you view it.

Interactive Navigation: Easily browse through dedicated sections for my work experience, educational background, technical skills, and a detailed project portfolio.

Project Showcase: Each project includes a description, the technologies used, and direct links to live demos or repository code, providing a deeper insight into my work.

Downloadable Resume: For those who prefer a traditional format, a quick link is available to download my resume as a PDF.

Contact Information: Multiple avenues are provided for easy communication, including a contact form or direct links to my professional social media profiles.

Technologies Utilized
The development of this website leveraged the following technologies to achieve its functionality and design:

Frontend: The user interface is crafted using HTML5 for structure, CSS3 for styling (potentially enhanced with frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Sass), and JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity. If a JavaScript framework like React.js, Vue.js, or Angular was used, it would be the core of the frontend development.

Deployment: The site is typically deployed using services like GitHub Pages or Netlify, ensuring easy access and reliable hosting.
